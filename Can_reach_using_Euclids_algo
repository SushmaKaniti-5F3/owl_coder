                                                                      -------------
Tevitt started his journey in a infinity grid, he will always begin his journey from (1,1) say (x,y) and his destination is (a,b),
though he has n number of ways to reach the destination (a,b) but he opted to move either in (x,x+y) or (x+y,y) path to reach the 
destination now your task is to find out weather he able to reach the destination by moving in (x,x+y) or (x+y,y), if he able to 
reach the destination print YES if not then print NO.
 
Input Format:
--------------
First line contains an integer Q which indicates no of queries. Next Q lines contains a, b which is destination quadrantes.

Output Format:
--------------
Display YES if can reach otherwise NO (in capital letters)


    PROGRAM:
----------------
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--)
    {
        int a,b;
        cin>>a>>b;
        while(a!=0 and b!=0)
        {
            (a>b)?(a=a-b):(b=b-a);
        }
        (a==1 or b==1)?(cout<<"YES"):(cout<<"NO");
        cout<<endl;
}
